Dear Mr. Mayor,

Next Saturday marks the 256th anniversary of the founding of the British
Museum. The superintendent of it is planning to celebrate the event with
a reception at Claridges Hotel on Saturday, January 17 between 5:00 p.m.
and 8:00 p.m. We shall be honored to have you as our chief guest who
will address the party for about four minutes.

I would appreciate it if you could indicate your availability or
inability to attend the reception before January 13.

Sincerely yours,

Tom Clarke
