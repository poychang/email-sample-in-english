Dear Sarah,

My husband and I should be very much pleased if you and your daughter
would dine with us at 6:30 p.m. next Sunday, on the eleventh floor of
the Emperor Building. I am inviting a few other people, and I hope we
may sing Karaoke after dinner. If you would consent to bring some video
tapes, I am sure we would have a most wonderful evening.

We do hope you can come and are expecting to see you then.

Yours cordially,

May Smith

親愛的莎拉：

我和我的丈夫非常高興地邀請妳和妳的女兒前來參加我們的晚宴。時間定於下個星期日下午六點半，地點位於帝國大廈十一樓。我還會再邀請一些人，我希望吃完晚飯我們可以去唱卡拉OK。如果妳能帶些錄影帶來，我相信我們將度過一個最美妙的夜晚。

我們真心希望妳們能夠前來，期待妳們屆時光臨。

梅．史密斯 謹上
