Dear Ms. Josephine,

We regret to inform you that we have to cancel our order No. PO0907020.
This shipment was completely wet when they arrived on May 08th, 2008,
and their system could not work at all. Please understand that I already
did my best to avoid this outcome.

Thanks in advance.

Sincerely Yours,

Richard Hofmann

敬愛的約瑟芬小姐：

我們很遺憾地通知妳，我們必須取消訂單PO0907020。這批貨在2008年5月8日抵達時就已經完全溼透了，而且它們的系統完全不能運作。請諒解我已經盡力來避免這種結果。

在此先謝謝妳！

理查．霍夫曼 謹上
