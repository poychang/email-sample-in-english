As you know, DongHuang Corporation is expanding.

Since you have expressed that you are very satisfied with our service, I
wonder if you could be so kind as to recommend some potential clients to
us for activating business.

We deeply appreciate any suggestions you may have to offer.

Sincerely yours,

Alex Jones
