Dear Mr. Ian,

I am afraid that we still have not received the receipt for our payment
regarding invoice NO.00942926. Three months have passed since we made
the payment in May.

This month, we will be closing our books for the year. If the receipt is
not sent by the end of the month, it will hold up our accounting
procedures.

Please turn you attention to this problem at once, as I would not like
to see something like this hinder our business relationship.

Yours faithfully,

Paul

親愛的伊恩先生：

我們仍然沒有收到我們支付您發票號碼為00942926的款項收據。自從五月份我們付款以來已經過了三個月。

本月我們要進行本年度的結算。如果月底的時候還收不到收據，將會導致我們的決算程序遲滯。請立即處理這個問題，因為我不想讓此類事情阻礙我們的業務關係。

保羅 謹上
