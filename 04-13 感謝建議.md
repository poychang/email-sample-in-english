Dear Mr. Steven,

Thank you very much for meeting with Ted and giving him of your helpful
advice about the legal profession. As I am sure you could tell that he
is very enthusiastic about law and eager to begin in this field.

He got a lot out of your talk and I can\'t think of a better example for
him to follow.

I appreciate your kind assistance and suggestions on behalf of my son.

Yours sincerely,

Peter
