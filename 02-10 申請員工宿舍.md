Dear Boss,

I am writing to you for solving a problem.

My name is Alvin Hsu, a new staff member of the company. I come from
Yunlin County, and came to the city alone, where is completely strange
to me. I have no relatives here and I have no money to rent a house. It
is definitely difficult for me to get accommodations. I sincerely hope
that the company could help solve my big problem. I hereby apply for a
dormitory.

Hoping for your approval!

Truly yours,

Alvin Hsu

親愛的老闆：

我寫信給您是為了解決一個問題。

我是公司的新進員工許艾文。我來自雲林縣，現在一個人來到這個對我完全陌生的城市，在這我沒有親戚，也沒有錢租房子。住宿對我來說真的很困難，我誠摯地希望公司能夠幫助我解決這個大難題，特此向老闆申請宿舍。

希望老闆批准！

艾文．許 敬上
