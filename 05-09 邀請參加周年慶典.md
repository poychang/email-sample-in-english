Dear residents of building#7,

You are cordially invited to share in a celebration of George and
Emma\'s 50th Wedding Anniversary.

Fifty years ago, a beautiful woman Emma and a handsome George promised
to love and cherish each other for the rest of their lives. Now, as
their dear friends, we will celebrate that commitment once more for
them.

Please join us in SURPRISE reception for George and Emma in the hall on
May 21, from 3 to 5 p.m. Thank you for your company.

Sincerely yours,

Jack Miller
