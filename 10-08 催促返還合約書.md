Dear Mr. Thomas,

I am writing to enquire if you have ever had a chance to review the
contract we sent. I refrained from mentioning this matter to you until
today, as you instructed us to wait for your response.

Please sign and return one copy of the contract at your earliest
convenience, because we really hope to start working on this project as
soon as possible.

Thank you for your prompt attention!

Sincerely yours,

Mike

親愛的湯瑪斯先生：

不知道您有沒有檢閱我們寄給您的合約。一直到今天才提及此事，是因為您告知我們等您的回覆。

方便的話，請您盡快簽署並將合約副本寄回好嗎？因為我們真的希望能夠盡快開始這個項目。

感謝您即時的關注！

邁可 謹上
