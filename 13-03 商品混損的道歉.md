Dear Ms. Robert,

We\'re extremely sorry to hear that the ornamental glass you ordered was
broken during the transportation.

We did instruct the forwarding company to handle your products very
carefully, but something obviously went wrong in the container.

Please wait while we negotiate with the forwarding company about how to
settle the matter best.

Truly yours,

Purity Glass Corporation

親愛的羅伯特女士：

得知您訂購的裝飾玻璃在運輸中毀損一事，我們感到非常遺憾。

我們確實有指示運輸公司要多加小心，但是顯然貨品在貨櫃中出現了問題。

對於解決此事的最佳對策，我方正與運輸公司進行交涉中，這段時間煩請您等待我們的回覆。

純淨玻璃公司 謹上
