Dear all,

All good things must come to an end. I am leaving this company.

When I look back on the past years, all the memories I have of working
with you are invaluable to me. I would like to deliver my heartfelt
thanks to all who have shown me your guidance, support and assistance.

Attached is my personal contact information.

Keep in touch and I wish all of you a promising future!

Warmly regards,

Mike Pan
