Dear Mrs. Alston,

I am very sorry to tell you that I have to cancel the dinner this
weekend.

I just heard that my mother is seriously ill. My husband and I must go
see her at once and we are leaving early tomorrow morning. Therefore, we
have to recall our dinner invitation this Saturday, the fourth of April.
However, we will plan on a party later on, and you will be cordially
invited then.

I am sure that you and Mr. Alston will understand our anxiety, and will
forgive this last minute change.

Sincerely yours,

Linda Peal

親愛艾爾斯頓夫人：

非常抱歉地通知您，這個週末的晚宴我們不得不取消了。

我剛剛接到我母親病重的消息，我和我丈夫必須立刻回去探病，我們明天一大早就要出發。所以我們不得不取消本週六，也就是四月四日的晚宴邀請。不過我們打算之後再舉辦一個聚會，到時我們一定會誠摯地邀請您。

我相信您和艾爾斯頓先生一定能理解我們焦急的心情，也一定會原諒我們不得不最後改變計畫。

琳達．皮爾 謹上
