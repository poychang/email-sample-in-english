Dear Mr. Evans,

Thank you for your offer to visit our company next week.

We very much regret, however, that our project is still in its infancy.
We will record your company name and contact you if there is a need.

Yours sincerely,

Will Smith

親愛的伊凡斯先生：

謝謝您提議下周來訪問我們。

但是，不好意思，我們的專案現在還處在初級階段。我們會記錄下貴寶號，如有需要會再聯繫您。

威爾．史密斯 謹上
