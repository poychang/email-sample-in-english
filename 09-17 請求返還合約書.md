Dear Mr. Billy,

Have you gone over the contract and found everything in order? We have
not contacted you until now, as you instructed us to wait for your
response.

Could you send us a copy of the signed contract as soon as possible? We
are eager to start our work soon.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,

Chris Ellen

親愛的比利先生：

你們是否已經看過合約並確認沒有問題了呢？您告知我們等您的回覆，所以我們直到今天才聯繫您。

您可否儘快把已經簽署好的合約寄回？我們很希望能儘早開工。

期待您的回覆！

克里斯．艾倫 謹上
