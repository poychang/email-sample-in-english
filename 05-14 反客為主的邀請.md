Dear Mr. Yang,

With great pleasure I have received your letter to invite me to have
lunch on Saturday, June 28.

I would be very happy to have the opportunity of discussing with you on
the proposed visit to Tokyo by your Minister of Education. I would be
even happier if you could let me host the lunch for you at 12:00 on that
day in the International Hotel. I am sure you will give me your consent
since you are in Tokyo and I should be the host.

I am looking forward to the pleasure of meeting you on Saturday at 12:00
in the lobby of the International Hotel.

With my best regards,

Hanna Wei

親愛的楊先生：

非常高興收到您的來信，以及您希望我出席六月二十八日（星期六）午宴的邀請。

我非常願意有此機會與您討論貴國教育部長擬訪問東京事宜，更願意於那天十二點在國際飯店宴請您。既然您來到了東京，我就應盡地主之誼，您一定不會反對吧。

我期待星期六十二點在國際飯店大廳見到您。

獻上最誠摯的祝福，

漢娜．魏
