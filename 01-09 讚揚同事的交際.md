Dear Kevin,

First of all, congratulations on meeting and exceeding our goals for
school instrument sales in October!

You worked on arranging for a trade-in for a completely new set of
instruments and helped make October a month to remember.

I hope you will put the bonus check to good use, and continue to bring
new ideas to the sales department.

Sincerely yours,

John Diamond

親愛的凱文：

首先，恭喜你達到並超過了十月份的學校樂器銷售目標！

你以舊換新的點子使得十月份成為了值得紀念的月份。

我希望您能好好利用這筆獎金，並且繼續為我們銷售部提供新的點子。

約翰．戴爾蒙 謹上
