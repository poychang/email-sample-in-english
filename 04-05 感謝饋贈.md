Dear Cecily,

I was so excited yesterday evening that I am sure I did not thank you
adequately for the beautiful Christmas gift. The woolen shawl is lovely
and exactly the color I would have selected myself.

Now that winter has come, it is indeed the right time to wear the warm
shawl. I will think of you with gratitude and affection every time I
wear it.

Many thanks to you again and our best wishes to you for the New Year!

Affectionately yours,

Lucy

親愛的希絲莉：

昨晚，我真是太激動了。我肯定沒有好好地感謝妳送我這麼漂亮的聖誕禮物。那條羊毛披肩著實令人喜愛，顏色也正是我喜歡的。

現在冬天已經來臨，正好是圍件溫暖披肩的時候。每當我\
圍上它的時候，我就會帶著感情和感激的心情想起妳。

再次向妳表示感謝，並向妳致上最美好的新年祝福！

妳親愛的好友，

露西
