Dear Ms. Jane,

I\'d like to ask you that would you please serve as our speaker on
National Advertising Directors Association? I can think of no one more
qualified to fill this role than you. NADA is prepared to pay all your
expenses. The media panel is scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. on Thursday,
October 16, 2008 and end no later than 5 p.m.

I do hope it will be possible for you to undertake this assignment. Let
me know as soon as you can, please. If your response is favorable, I\'ll
send other information to you.

Sincerely yours,

NADA Organizer
