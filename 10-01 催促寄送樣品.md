Dear Mr. Brown,

Please inform us if the samples we requested have already been sent.

It has been two weeks since we received your letter confirming that the
samples will be delivered to us, but they have not arrived yet.

I would like to remind you that we are holding a meeting next week to
select the items we will buy in the next year, and your products will be
excluded from our purchasing list if the samples can\'t arrive in time.
Please be quick!

Sincerely yours,

ABC Company

親愛的布朗先生：

請告知我們要求寄送的樣品是否已經寄出。

兩個星期前我們收到您的信，確認樣品將會寄給我們，但是我們至今仍未收到。我想提醒您的是，下周我們要舉行會議，選擇明年我們將購買的產品，如果樣品沒有及時送達，您的產品將無法列在我們的採購清單中。請速寄！

ABC 公司 謹上
