Dear Mr. Justin,

We are pleased to inform you that the goods of PO0811023 arrived at
Taipei, Taiwan yesterday morning. But there is no formal Commercial
Invoice attached. I have asked the courier agent to look for it
throughout these cartons and nothing was found. Please mail the Invoice
immediately for custom purpose. We sincerely hope that this situation
will not happen again. It caused us a lot of trouble in custom
clearance.

Looking forward to receiving your Commercial Invoice immediately.

Sincerely Yours,

Sam Collins

敬愛的賈斯汀先生：

我們很高興通知你的訂單昨天早上已經抵達台灣台北，但是卻沒有正式的商業發票。我已經叫空運業者把這些箱子都翻了一遍，就是找不到可以通關的發票。我們衷心地期待這種狀況不會再發生，因為這樣造成了我們在海關通關時莫大的困擾。

期待立刻能收到你的商業發票！

山姆．科林斯 謹上
