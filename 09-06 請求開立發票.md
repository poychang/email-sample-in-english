Dear Mr. Ui,

I need you to open the invoice for my two pairs of high-heel shoes
bought from your store on June 2. I guess you might have forgotten to
issue the invoice for me because of busy work.

Please give your attention to this problem at once, as I would not like
to see something like this have effect on your credit standing.

Yours faithfully,

Rose Lear

親愛的烏伊先生：

我要您為我在六月二日在貴店購買的兩雙高跟鞋開具發票。我猜想一定是你太忙碌所以忘記開了。

因此請立即處理這個問題，因為我不想讓此類事情影響到貴店的信譽。

羅絲．李爾 謹上
