Dear Mr. Jackman,

I am writing to inquire if your company has any opening in the area of
food engineering. I have long been interested in working in your
company. Although I am a recent graduate with some intern experience, I
still want to pursue a job which I find fascinating.

If possible, please reply and I will send you a resume via e-mail. Thank
you for you time.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Yours sincerely,

Andy Carter

親愛的傑克曼先生：

我寫信給您是想詢問貴公司是否還有食品工程領域的職位空缺。我一直很嚮往到貴公司工作。儘管我才剛畢業不久，只有一些實習經驗，但是，我還是想找一份自己心儀的工作。

如果有的話，煩請回覆，我將e-mail我的簡歷給您。謝謝您的寶貴時間！

殷切期待您的回音！

安迪‧卡特 謹上
