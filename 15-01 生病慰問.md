Dear Mr. Jackson,

I have missed you so much and you have been on my mind ever since you
went to the hospital.

I hope that by the time this note reaches you, you will be feeling a
great deal better. I am sure that now it will not be long before you are
entirely and completely yourself again. Everyone at the office hopes you
can be back soon.

Yours sincerely,

John Walker

我相信用不了多長時間，您就會完全康復的。\
