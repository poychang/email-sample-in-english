Dear Brown,

This is to tell you that I\'ve arrived home now. I wish to express my
thanks to you for the wonderful vacation I spent with you and your
family. During the vacation, you taught me how to swim, boat and fish. I
really appreciate your taking time off work to show me around so many
places.

Your wife is such a terrific cook! I think I must have gained 10 pounds
just in the week I spent with you. Surely, I\'ve had a happy and
memorable vacation. Thanks again.

I hope you will be able to visit us sometime. Let\'s keep in touch.

Truly yours,

Luke Wang

親愛的布朗先生：

我已經回到家了！非常感謝您和您的家人陪我度過一個如此美好的假期。假期中，您在百忙之中抽空陪我，教我學會游泳、划船、釣魚，還陪我到處逛，參觀很多地方，我真的很感激。

您的妻子廚藝真棒！我想一個星期的時間我一定長了10磅肉呢！我度過了一個愉快而難忘的假期。再次表示感謝。

希望您也能有機會來我們這裡玩。保持聯絡哦！

路克．王 謹上
