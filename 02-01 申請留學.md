Dear Sir or Madam,

I would like to apply for admission to your university as a Master\'s
student in Applied Economics next September.

I am in my fourth year of undergraduate studies at Taiwan National
University at present, and I will receive a Bachelor of Arts in
Economics in July. It has been my dream to pursue graduate studies at
the University of Pennsylvania, an institution well-known for its
excellent faculty and students as well as the strong leadership in the
field of economics. I am confident that I would benefit a lot from the
rich academic and cultural community of your university.

As requested, I have sent two letters of recommendation, an original
copy of my university transcript, and a copy of my TOEFL certificate.
Please also find attached my completed application form.

Thank you very much for your consideration. I look forward to hearing
from you soon.

Sincerely yours,

David Wang

親愛的敬啟者：

我想申請貴校明年9月開學的應用經濟學碩士課程。

我現在是一名台灣大學的大四學生，將於今年7月份獲得經濟學學士學位。能去賓州大學讀研究所一直是我的夢想。貴校教員和學生都相當優秀，而且貴校在經濟學領域裡享有極高的聲譽。我相信我將在這個富有學術和文化氣息的校園裡受到薰陶，受益匪淺。

我已經按照貴校的要求，將兩份推薦信、一份大學成績單正本，以及一份托福成績單副本寄出。入學申請表請參見附件。

非常感謝您對我的申請予以考慮。期待能盡快收到您的回覆。

大衛．王 敬上
