Dear Topher,

I am most grieved to hear of the loss of your mother, my beloved aunt,
and hasten to offer my deepest sympathy.

You would find comfort in the fact that you lived happily with your
mother these years. She was also gratified by your filial piety and
accomplishments. I hope that would ease your grief.

Please convey my deepest sympathy to all your family.

Yours sincerely,

Randy Sloan

親愛的托佛：

得知你母親，也就是我親愛的姨媽去世的消息，我深感悲痛，並立刻寫信向你表示我最深切的慰問。

這些年，你和母親生活愉快，你應當為此感到寬慰。而她也曾為你的孝順和成就感到欣慰。希望這些能減輕你的哀痛。

請向你全家轉達我最深切的慰問。

藍迪．史隆 謹上
