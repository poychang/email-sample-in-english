Dear Mr. Carter,

Our company is interested in leasing a big storehouse rather than
purchasing one. It will mainly be used to store our products shipped
from foreign companies. There is a large quantity of them.

Please inform us of the detailed information about the lease, including
the total area of the storehouse and its payment requirements.

Looking forward to your reply!

Yours sincerely,

Ronan Kendy

親愛的卡特先生：

我們公司不想購買，只想租下一個大倉庫，主要用來存放我們從國外公司運進的產品，這些產品數量很大。

煩請告知我們有關租賃的詳細資訊，包括倉庫總面積和還有付款要求。

期待您的回覆！

羅南．坎迪 謹上
