Dear Mr. Mitchell,

You mentioned that you would be getting back to me concerning the
outcome of our meeting by March 5, 2009. Since that date has passed, I
think I should write to make sure that you have no additional questions.

Your prompt consideration would be greatly appreciated and you can reach
me at 02-2645-3280.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Yours sincerely,

David Reynolds

親愛的米契爾先生：

您說過會於2009年3月5日之前通知我面試的結果。由於日期已過，我想我應該確認一下您是否有其他問題。

如您能及時考慮，我將不勝感激。你可以電話聯繫我，我的電話是02-2645-3280。

殷切期盼您的回覆！

大衛‧雷諾茲 謹上
