Dear Robin,

On Sunday, August 11, at three o\'clock p.m., Richard and I are taking
the important step in life. We are gettig married at St. Peter\'s, that
charming little church---you know it---at 26 Freeway Drive.

We have sent the invitation card to you. I hardly need to tell you that
we would not consider it a real wedding if you were not present. There
will be an informal reception in the church parlor afterward and we want
you there, too.

Affectionately yours,

Mary

親愛的羅賓：

8月1日，星期日下午三點，我和理查將邁入人生重要的一步。我們將在聖彼得這座迷人的小教堂裡舉行婚禮。這個教堂在弗利韋大道26號，這個你是知道的吧。

我們已經將請柬寄去給你了。不用說，如果你不來的話，這場婚禮就不像是真正的婚禮。婚禮後還會在教堂接待室舉行便宴，希望你能賞光。

你親愛的好友，

瑪麗
