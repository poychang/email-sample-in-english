Dear Loan Section Head,

I\'m writing this letter in applying 150,000 dollars from your bank for
opening a Japanese\
cuisine restaurant.

I\'ve carried out a survey and found that there is only a small
restaurant selling Japanese foods. The potential Japanese food market is
large and we have sufficient customers. What\'s more, we have employed
excellent cooks that can ensure the quality of the meal. The loan money
will be used in the inner decoration. My partner, Peter and I will
provide real\
estate of our families that is worth 200,000 dollars as guarantee.

Approving this loan will prove a wise choice. Please consider our
application seriously and we are looking forward to your response!

Sincerely yours,

Ted Green

親愛的貸款部門經理：

我寫這封信是為了向貴行申請十五萬美元的貸款來開一家日本餐館。

我已經做了一下調查，發現這裡只有一家很小的日式餐館。日式餐飲的潛在市場非常的大，並且我們有充足的客源。此外，我們有很棒的廚師來確保餐飲的品質。申請的貸款將用於室內裝潢。我的合夥人彼得和我將會提供我們價值二十萬美元的房產作為擔保。

貸款給我們是明智的選擇，請慎重考慮我們的申請，並期待您的答覆！

泰德．格林 謹上
