Dear Mr. Branden,

We have ordered five computers (No. 4879) on February 20, but we
haven\'t received them yet. Would you tell us when you will be
delivering these computers which should have arrived a week ago?

We desperately need them for our new employees.

Please respond without delay!

Yours sincerely,

Jim Landy

親愛的布蘭登先生：

我們於 2 月 20 號在貴公司訂購了五台電腦（商品編號為
4879），但至今尚未收到貨品。貴公司能否告知這些原本一周前就應該到貨的電腦將何時出貨呢？

我們急需這些電腦供新員工使用。

請儘快回覆！

吉姆．蘭迪 謹上
