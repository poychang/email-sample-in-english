Dear Mr. White,

We are terribly sorry for the late remittance this time. As the wines
are not yet sold, nor are they likely to be for some time, we could not
pay in time. Please accept our earnest apology.

We can ensure that you will receive the remittance on time in the
future.

We appreciate it very much for your understanding.

Yours faithfully,

Cecily Jones

親愛的懷特先生：

有關這次的逾期匯款，我們感到非常抱歉。由於葡萄酒尚未售出，近期也難有改觀，我們無法及時付款。無論如何，請接受我們誠摯的歉意。

我們保證以後一定會準時匯款。

非常感謝您的諒解。

希絲莉．瓊斯 謹上
