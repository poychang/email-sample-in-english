Dear Mr. Grace,

We regret very much that we are unable to postpone the fixed date of our
appointment, because we have another client who is quite willing to
cooperate with us.

An early reply would be appreciated as we wish to reach a prompt
decision.

Yours sincerely,

Paul Walker

親愛的格雷斯先生：

很抱歉，我們無法延後我們定好的約會時間，因為已經有另外一名客戶很想跟我們合作。

本公司希望能盡快下決定，故請您及早回覆。

保羅．沃克 謹上
