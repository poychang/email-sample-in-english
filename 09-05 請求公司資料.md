Dear Sir or Madam,

I would like to request information about your company to facilitate my
research for a school project.

The project focuses on start-up food processing companies and their
impact within the industry. I would appreciate any corporate brochures
or marketing materials with which you could provide me.

Thank you very much for your help!

Yours sincerely,

Monica Ali

敬啟者：

我想向貴公司諮詢一些資訊，以幫助我進行一個專案研究。

這個項目主要是針對食品初加工的公司以及其對該行業的影響。如果您能提供一些可以公布的公司業務簡介或市場銷售資料提供給我的的話，我將不勝感激。

非常感謝您的幫助！

莫妮卡．阿里 謹上
