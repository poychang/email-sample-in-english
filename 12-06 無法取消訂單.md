Dear Mr. Carter,

We have got your email of October 5 requesting to cancel the order of
No. 8888.

However, we are unable to accept such a cancellation, as we have already
had the goods shipped. We most sincerely hope you will afford us your
understanding.

Yours sincerely,

Ronan Keating

親愛的卡特先生：

謝謝您在10月5日的來信，信中要求取消第8888號訂貨。

然而，我們無法接受該項訂單取消。因為貨物已經裝船了。我們真誠希望您能諒解。

羅南．基頓 謹上
