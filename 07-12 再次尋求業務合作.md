Dear Mr. Johnson,

Since our last conversation, two years have passed.

We very much regret we lost our last trade opportunity, but we are so
happy that we still have an opportunity ahead of us now. We have been
extending the scope of our products in the past years. I am sure some
items would be of great interest to you.

The catalogue and all necessary information for your reference are
enclosed.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,

Chris Ellen

親愛的強森先生：

自從上次的聯繫後，兩年已經過去了。

儘管我們對上次不能合作而感到深深的遺憾，但是，我們現在仍然很高興，有了新的機會。過去的幾年中，我們一直在擴大產品範圍。相信一些產品將會讓您頗感興趣。

隨函附上目錄和有關資料，供您參考。

期待您的回覆！

克里斯．艾倫 謹上
