Dear Mr. Leto,

Thank you for your E-mail of March 22.

We are sorry to inform you that the products, though with high content
of science and technology, are not well calculated for our market.

We are hoping to work with you next time. Please keep in touch for more
business.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,

Philip Walker

親愛的萊托先生：

謝謝您在3月22日發來的電子郵件。

很遺憾，我們不得不通知貴公司，你們的產品雖然高科技含量高，但不適合本地市場。

希望有機會下次合作。請保持聯繫。

期待您的回覆！
