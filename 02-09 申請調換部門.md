Dear Sir or Madam,

This is Chrissie Snow from Administrative Department. I have worked here
for 6 months since May 2, 2008. I am always working very hard in my post
and doing my best to pursue perfection.

I love our company, and I really hope I could have long-term development
here. Therefore, I want to know the company overall. As the Market
Department is the leading department, which is in charge of the main
business, I want to enter this department to learn more. I promise I
will work as hard in the new department as in my current department.

I desperately hope for your permission!

Sincerely yours,

Chrissie Snow

親愛的敬啟者：

我是行政部門的克麗絲‧史諾，於2008年5月2日開始在這個部門工作，至今已有 6
個月的時間了。工作中，我始終堅持努力工作，每項工作都力求完美。

我很熱愛我們公司，並希望能夠在這裡得到長遠的發展，所以我想瞭解公司更多部門的工作。行銷部是公司的主要部門，負責公司的主要業務，我希望公司能夠同意我前往這個部門學習，我一定會像在現在這個部門一樣努力工作。

熱切盼望您的批准！

克麗絲‧史諾 敬上
