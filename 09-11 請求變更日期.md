Dear Mr. Wills,

I feel regret that I won\'t be able to make it to the meeting we set up
at your firm on March 14.

However, I am wondering if I could visit your office on either of the
following two days, March 15 or 16, since I would like to meet with you
as soon as possible.

Please contact me at your earliest is convenience.

Yours truly,

George Green

親愛的威爾斯先生：

我感到非常抱歉，我在三月十四日不能按原定行程訪問貴公司。但是我想儘快見面，您能在三月十五日或者三月十六日擇日與我見面嗎？

請盡快與我聯絡。

喬治．格林 謹上
