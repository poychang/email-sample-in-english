Dear Mr. Reeves,

We are most gratified that you have, for several years, included a
selection of our products in your order catalogues.

We are pleased to inform you our latest product is available now. The
new machine vastly excels the old one in performance. If you, our old
customer, are interested in it, we can offer you a 10% discount.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,

Kevin Smith

親愛的李維先生：

鑒於貴公司的訂貨目錄多年來收錄本公司產品，特此致上深切謝意。

我們很高興告知您，我們現在有最新產品上市了。新機器在性能上大大超越舊的。如果您對它感興趣，我們可以給老客戶九折優待。

期待您的回覆！

凱文．史密斯 謹上
