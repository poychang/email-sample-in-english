Dear Felicity,

You may not like to be reminded that you are a year older today. But
that is not going to prevent me from saying \"Happy Birthday\" to you!

If my memory does not fail me, it is your 26th birthday today. Please
accept my best wishes for this occasion. I hope that it is going to be a
very happy day and that there will be many happy returns.

I\'m sending you a bouquet of flowers and a birthday card, which I hope
you will enjoy.

Yours affectionately,

Lisa Green

親愛的費莉希蒂：

妳也許不願意被人提醒，今天妳又老了一歲。但這也阻止不了我對妳說一聲：「生日快樂！」

如果我沒記錯的話，今天是妳二十六歲的生日。此時此刻，請接受我最誠摯的祝福。我祝妳生日快樂，而且今後年年如此。

我寄了一束鮮花和一張生日賀卡給妳，希望妳會喜歡。

妳的好友

莉莎．格林 謹上
