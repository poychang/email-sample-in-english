Dear Lisa,

It\'s so great that you finally have your own house with a beautiful
view! And thanks for telling me your new home address.

Congratulations on your move to the new house next week and it would be
my great honor to visit your new home someday.

I have sent a bouquet of flowers to you and hope you will like it. Best
wishes to you and all your family members!

Sincerely yours,

Jim
