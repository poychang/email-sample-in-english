Dear Mr. Moore,

My wife joins me in thanking you and your kind wife for a delightful
night at your house last Sunday.

The delicious food, pleasant company and intelligent conversation made
the occasion an unforgettable one for both of us.

Once again we\'d like to express our thankfulness to you for your
zealous invitation and warm friendship. I wish you and your family good
health and happiness forever.

Sincerely yours,

Tom Smith
