Dear Mr. Campus,

Thank you for your cooperation for our business.

We would like to explore the new potential market and increase the
export of textiles.

Therefore we shall appreciate it very much if you could kindly introduce
us to some of the most capable importers who are interested in them.

Your early reply will be greatly appreciated.

Yours sincerely,

Scott Gordon
