Dear Mr. Affleck,

According to our contract, we can cancel the order only if you inform us
three weeks prior to the delivery date. However, you just did this
without notifying us in advance.

Moreover, we haven\'t got a reasonable explanation from your side yet.
You\'ll have to give us a satisfactory answer for the matter mentioned
above.

Yours sincerely,

Paul Walker

親愛的艾佛列克先生：

根據合約規定，我們只能接受提前在發貨日期三周的訂單取消要求。然而，貴公司未提前通知就取消訂單了。

而且，我們至今還未得到一個合理的解釋。請貴公司給我們一個滿意的答覆！

保羅．沃克 謹上
