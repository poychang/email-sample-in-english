Dear Mr. Affleck,

I will be going on a business trip in your city with one colleague from
March 6, 2009 to March 12, 2009. As far as I know, your business is
brisk all the time, but I would appreciate it if you could reserve two
single rooms under my name for us. Thank you in advance.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Yours sincerely,

Colin Farrell

親愛的艾佛列克先生：

我在2009年3月6日到12日期間，將和一位同事到你們城市出差。據我所知，貴旅館的生意一向很好。不過，如果您能在上述時間，以我的名義，幫我們預訂兩間單人房，我將不勝感激。先謝謝您了！

殷切期待您的回覆！

科林．法洛 謹上
