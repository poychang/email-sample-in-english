Dear Marco,

I learned from today\'s newspaper that you set up your own private
company, which I think resulted from many years of your hard work and
experience in managing foreign trade.

Please accept my warmest congratulations. I do hope your company enjoys
a smooth development and you yourself will find the happiness and good
luck in this new venture.

Wishing you a flourishing business!

Yours faithfully,

Edmond

親愛的馬可：

我從今天的報紙上得知你創立了自己的公司，這是你多年來從事對外貿易的努力和積累的經驗的結果。

請接受我最熱烈的祝賀。我非常希望你的公司能夠順利發展，而且你本人也能在這項新的事業中找到快樂和幸運。

祝你生意興隆！

艾德蒙 謹上
