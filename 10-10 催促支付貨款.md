Dear Mr. Harris,

This is about your Account No.7658.

As you are usually very prompt in settling your accounts, we wonder
whether there is any special reason why we have not received payment of
the above account, already a month overdue.

We think you might not have received the statement of account we sent
you on July 25th showing the balance of US\$ 60,000 you owe. We have
sent you another copy today and hope it may have your early attention.

Yours faithfully,

Longmans Co.

親愛的哈里斯先生：

此信是關於您的第7658號帳單。

鑒於貴方總是及時結清貨款，而此次逾期一個月仍未收到貴方上述帳目的欠款，我們想知道是否有何特殊原因。

我們猜想貴方可能未收到我們7月25日發出的60,000美元欠款的帳單。現寄出一份，並希望貴方及早處理。

朗曼斯公司 謹上
