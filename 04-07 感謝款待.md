Dear Mr. Geng,

Thank you very much for your wonderful hospitality during our stay in
Beijing. I would like to express my appreciation to you for making our
trip such an enjoyable and successful one.

We sincerely appreciate you for taking time out of your busy schedule to
show us around your office and factory. I also hope that you will have a
chance to visit us in London in the near future.

Yours truly,

Jessica

親愛的耿先生：

非常感謝我們到北京時您對我們的熱情款待。感謝您為我們安排了如此愉快成功的旅程。

衷心地感謝您在百忙之中抽出時間帶我們參觀您的辦公室和工廠。也期望您能在不遠的將來抽空到倫敦找我們。

潔西卡 謹上
