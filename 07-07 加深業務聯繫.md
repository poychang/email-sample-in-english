Dear Mr. Scott,

Thank you for your cooperation with our business in the recent years.

Now we keen to enlarge our trade in various kinds of electric
equipments, but unfortunately we do not have enough circulating funds.

Please don\'t hesitate to call us if there is any possibility of
cooperation between us.

Your early reply will be greatly appreciated.

Yours sincerely,

Simon Grimes

親愛的史考特先生：

感謝貴公司在這最近幾年裡與我們的業務合作。

目前，我們很想擴大各種電氣設備的貿易，但是，我們流動資金短缺。

如果我們雙方有任何合作的可能，請儘管聯繫我們。

期待您的回覆！

賽門．格瑞姆斯 謹上
