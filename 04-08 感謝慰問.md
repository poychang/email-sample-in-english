Dear Anne,

I shall always remember with gratitude the e-mail you sent me when you
learned of Jane\'s death. No one but you knew my sister so well and
loved her as her own family did. Only you could have written that
letter. It brought me comfort, Anne, when I needed it badly.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your e-mail and for your
kindness to Jane during her long illness.

Affectionately,

Elizabeth

親愛的安：

當妳聽說珍恩病故後發給我的那封電子郵件，使我一輩子都不能忘懷。妳像我們家人一樣瞭解我姐姐，並且愛她，只有妳能寫出那樣的慰問信來。在我悲痛萬分的時候，安妮，你的信給了我安慰。

我打從心底感謝妳，感謝妳的來信，感謝\
妳在珍恩久病期間給予她的深切同情。

妳親愛的好友，

伊莉莎白
