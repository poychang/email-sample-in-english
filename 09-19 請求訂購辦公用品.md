Dear Mr. Wright,

I learned from your advertisement on the Internet that your company
supplies digital projectors.

In order to facilitate our sales team in delivering presentations to
current and prospective clients, I want to buy a digital projector from
your company. The attached application details the projector\'s intended
use and lists product information, including model, price and technical
specifications. Could you deliver what I want to our company before
February 28?

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,

Donald Perry

親愛的賴特先生：

在網路上獲悉貴公司的廣告，得知貴公司提供數位投影機。

為了便於我們銷售人員向客戶（包括現有客戶和潛在客戶）做出更好的講解並演示產品，特向您申請購買一部數位投影機。附件裡有一份申請書，上面已經寫明投影儀的具體用途和產品的具體資訊，包括：型號、價格和規格。您能在本月28號之前將我需要的產品送至我公司嗎？

非常感謝您的考慮。

唐納德．佩里 謹上
