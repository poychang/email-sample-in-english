Dear Mr. Farrell,

We are going to hold a large meeting in our city hall on Tuesday.

If possible, we would like to use a projector to give a slide show. We
also need several people to pass out the pamphlets to the members
present during the meeting.

We would very much appreciate it if you would solve these problems for
us.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,

Terry Affleck

親愛的法洛先生：

我們將於星期二在市政廳舉辦一個大型會議。

如果可能的話，我們想利用投影機放映幻燈片。此外，我們還需要幾個人在會議期間進行協助，向出席者發送一些小冊子。

如若能解決上述問題，將不勝感激。

期待您的回覆！

泰瑞．艾佛列克 謹上
