Dear Mr. Affleck,

We are so sorry that we can\'t continue to fulfill the contract on
account of the quality problem.

Many customers complained that these computers didn\'t run well after
the purchase. Due to this, we want to suspend the supply and hope you
can give us a solution to the problem immediately.

Yours sincerely,

Paul Walker

親愛的艾佛列克先生：

很抱歉，由於品質的問題，我們無法繼續履行合約。

眾多用戶抱怨購買電腦之後，電腦使用情況不佳。鑒於此，我們想暫停供貨，並希望你們能立即給出一個解決方案。

保羅．沃克 謹上
