Dear Service Department,

I am afraid I would like a refund for the skirt I returned earlier.

Because of the wrong size, I sent the skirt back to you on August 7, the
day after it arrived. However, the skirt was included in the bill
charged to my account. Could you refund me the money of the skirt?

Please confirm receipt of this letter by e-mail.

Yours faithfully,

Emma Blake

親愛的客服部：

我恐怕要拜託您退還我前幾日寄回的裙子的費用。

由於尺碼錯誤，我在收到的第二天，也就是八月七日就退貨了。但是，我銀行帳戶結賬的金額中卻包含了這條裙子的費用。能否將這筆費用退還給我呢？

收到這封信後請用電子郵件通知我。

愛瑪．布萊克 謹上
