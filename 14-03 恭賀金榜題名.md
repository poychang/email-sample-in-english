Dear Wilson,

I was extremely happy to hear the news of your admission to Yale
University last week and I am writing to send my wholehearted
congratulations to you.

As an old saying goes, \"No pains, no gains\", your success today is
closely related with you persistent hard work during the past three
years. I hope you will make greater achievement in the university.

Wishing you success and I hope we can keep in close contact.

Sincerely yours,

Steven

親愛的威爾森：

聽到你上周被耶魯大學錄取的消息，我非常高興，特寫信向你致以我衷心的祝賀。

正如諺語所說：「不勞無獲」，你今天的成功是與你過去三年堅持不懈的努力密切相關的，希望你在大學裡能取得更大的成就。

祝你成功，並保持密切聯繫。

史蒂芬 謹上
