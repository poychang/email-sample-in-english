Dear David,

To my relief, I heard that you have been discharged from hospital
yesterday. I believe it is worth a celebrating party to welcome you
back.

However, since you just left hospital still need time to recover from
the illness completely, so please stay at home and have a good rest.
Take care of yourself and I will come to see you ASAP.

I hope you can get well soon.

Sincerely yours,

Peter

親愛的大衛：

得知你昨天出院回家了，我終於鬆了口氣。我覺得我們應該開個派對慶祝你的歸來。

然而，既然你剛剛出院，可能還需要一段時間才能完全康復，所以希望你待在家裡好好休息，好好照顧自己，過兩天我會去看你的。

祝你儘快早日完全康復！

彼得 謹上
