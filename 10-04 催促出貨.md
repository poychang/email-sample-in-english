Dear Mr. Thomas,

Regarding the sales contract NO.3624 covering 400 dozen sport suits, we
wish to remind you that we have had no news from you about shipment of
the goods.

As we mentioned in our last letter, we are in urgent need of the goods.
And if you are not able to supply them in time, we may be compelled to
seek an alternative source of supply.

We look forward to receiving your shipping advice, by fax, within the
next seven days.

Yours faithfully,

Tony Smith

親愛的湯瑪斯先生：

有關訂貨單號3624訂購400打運動服事宜，至今尚未收到貴公司的出貨通知。

正如我們致貴公司的電子郵件裡所提到的，我們急需此批貨物。如貴公司未能及時供貨，本公司可能被迫尋求其他貨源。

麻煩您請於七天內將出貨通知傳真給我。

東尼．史密斯 謹上
