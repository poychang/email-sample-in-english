Dear Mr. Harding,

I am terribly sorry for the overdue balance on our account. It turns out
that the last invoice we received from you was somehow misplaced.

Would it be possible to grant us a 5-day payment extension? I can ensure
that you will receive the outstanding balance by next Thursday.

I appreciate your understanding very much.

Yours faithfully,

Catherine Jones

親愛的哈丁先生：

非常抱歉我們逾期未能付清帳款。原來是上次您的發票寄來之後不知怎麼找不到了。

我想問一下可不可以再延長五天的支付期限呢？我保證下週四之前您可以收到未付帳款。

非常感謝您的諒解。

凱薩琳．瓊斯 謹上
