Dear Ben,

We had been hoping that during this difficult period of reorganization
we could keep all of our employees with the company. Unfortunately, this
is not the case.

It is with regret, therefore, that we have to inform you that we will be
unable to utilize your services anymore. We have been pleased with the
qualities you have exhibited during your tenure of employment, and will
be sorry to lose you.

We wish you a promising future!

Yours truly,

ABC Co.

親愛的班恩：

我們一直希望能夠在此次重組的困難時期保留公司的全體雇員，不幸的是這個願望無法實現。

因此，公司不得不遺憾地通知您，我們無法再繼續雇用您。公司一直很滿意你在受聘期間所展現的素質，並為失去您這樣的雇員感到遺憾。

祝福您前程似錦！

ABC 公司 謹上
