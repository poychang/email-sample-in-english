Dear Bob,

I want to ask you that if you could please return the documents I lent
you last month?

As I explained to you earlier, they are very important to me. I really
need you to return them as soon as possible.

I have already reminded you of this matter for several times. Please
tell me frankly, what on earth is the reason that you can\'t return
them? In fact, I really don\'t want something like this to get in the
way of our relationship.

Yours truly,

Fiona

親愛的鮑勃：

我想請問你，能否把上個月借給您的資料還給我呢？

正如我早先向你解釋的，那些資料對我非常重要。我真的需要你盡快歸還它們。

我已經提醒你好幾次了，能坦白地告訴我到底是什麼原因使你不能返還嗎？我真的不想因為這件事影響到我們之間的關係。

費歐娜 謹上
