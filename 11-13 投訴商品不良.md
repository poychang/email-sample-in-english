Dear Mr. Matthew,

I regret to inform you that the delivery of these products was
classified as inferior. Please take care of this matter very carefully.
These products arrived at our factory in good condition, but we found
that the software was not stable. As a result of it, we have to ask your
company to compensate. Maybe you can give us a discount or something
like that on our next purchasing order.

Please send my greetings to your new family member, and contact me if
needed.

Sincerely Yours,

Albert Lai

敬愛的馬修先生：

很遺憾地通知你這些出貨的產品被定位為次級品，在處理這件事時請多加注意。這些產品到公司的狀況良好，但我們發現軟體不穩定。因此，我們必須向貴公司求償，也許是類似在下次的訂購單打折之類的。

請代我向你家的新成員問好，如果需要的話請聯絡我。

艾伯特．賴 謹上
