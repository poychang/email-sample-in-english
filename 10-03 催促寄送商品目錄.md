Dear Service Department,

I would like to inquire if you have sent us the Supermarket Catalogue.

I requested it three weeks ago. I haven\'t received it yet. Could you
tell me what the problem is? If there is no problem at all, please send
it to me ASAP. I am afraid that I will have to consider other products
from other supermarkets if you do not make any prompt response.

Yours sincerely,

Bree Quain

親愛的客服部：

我想請問您是否已經把超市商品目錄寄給我了？我三個星期之前就向您要了，可是現在還沒收到。能告訴我是有什麼問題嗎？如果沒有問題，請盡快寄給我。如果您不立即答覆我的話，我將不得不考慮其他超市的產品了。

布麗．昆恩 謹上
