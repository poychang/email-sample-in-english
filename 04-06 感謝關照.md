Dear Mary,

This is to express my appreciation.

I would like to thank you for your enthusiasm and hospitality during my
visit to your country. It was my first experience staying overseas for
two months, so I was a little nervous in the beginning. However, you
treated me like a member of your family and made me feel at home.

Please give my pure-hearted regards and special thanks to your family.

I look forward to hearing from you again as soon as possible.

Kindest regards,

Catharine

親愛的瑪麗：

寫這封信是為了表達感謝之情。

在我參觀貴國期間，多謝您的熱情款待。這是我第一次在海外待兩個月之久，剛開始還有些緊張。但是您把我當成自己家中的一員，讓我感覺毫無拘束。

請代我向您的家人致上誠摯的問候及特別的感謝。

期待盡快收到您的來信。

獻上最誠摯的問候，

凱薩琳
