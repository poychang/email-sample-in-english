Dear Mr. Walker,

I would like to have your latest catalogue so that I can purchase mobile
phone accessories.

I will contact you regarding any items I may be interested in after
receiving the catalogue. Thank you in advance.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,

Willy Simon
