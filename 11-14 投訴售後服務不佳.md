Dear Mr. Martin,

We delivered our products to your RMA Dept. on the end of March, which
should be returned to our company in early April. But we still have not
received them yet. After all, we have been your customer for five years,
but I don\'t think your after-sales service is satisfactory this time.
Please let me know your company\'s maintaining schedule.

Your earliest reply will be highly appreciated.

Sincerely Yours,

Anthony Johnson

敬愛的馬汀先生：

我們已經在三月底送了一批維修產品到你們的維修部門，那應該四月初就要送達我們公司才對。但是我到現在還沒收到。雖然我們五年來都是貴公司的客戶，但是我覺得你們的售後服務實在令人不滿意。請讓我知道貴公司的維修排程。

期待你最迅速的回覆。

安東尼．強森 謹上
