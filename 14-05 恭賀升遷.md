Dear Mr. Green,

I am very delighted to have the confirmation today of your promotion to
the office of the Vice-minister of Foreign Affairs. It is an outstanding
achievement in a very competitive field, and I should like to offer my
warmest congratulations.

May I also take this opportunity of thanking you for the help which you
have always so readily given in all circumstances. I\'m looking forward
to working with you in your new responsibilities as in your earlier ones
for the best interests of our two countries.

My colleagues join me in wishing you every happiness and success in the
important tasks that lie before you.

Sincerely yours,

Thomas Ray
