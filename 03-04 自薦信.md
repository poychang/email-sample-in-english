Dear Mr. Johnson,

I worked as an English editor for two years, but I have held a
particular interest in teaching English since I was an English
Department student in University.

With my knowledge in English, work experience, patience and passion for
teaching, I believe I am capable of doing this job. Please consider me
for the teaching position. If possible, you can contact me at
02-2987-6543.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Yours sincerely,

Kevin Seal

親愛的強森先生：

我曾做過兩年的英文編輯工作。但是，從我還是一個英文系的學生開始，我就對英語教學特別有興趣。

憑藉著我的英語知識、工作經驗、耐心和對教學的熱誠，我相信我能勝任這份工作。敬請考慮我對這個教學職位的申請。如果可能的話，您可以電話聯繫我，我的電話是02-2987-6543。

期待您的回音！

凱文‧席爾 謹上
