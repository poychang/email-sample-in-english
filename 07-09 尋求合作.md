Dear Mr. Grey,

We have obtained your address from the Times and are writing to you to
seek collaboration.

We are very well connected with all the major dealers of electronic
products here, and feel confident that we can sell large quantities of
them if you can give us a special offer.

Your early reply will be greatly appreciated.

Yours sincerely,

Adam Brendy

親愛的葛雷先生：

期待您的回覆！
