Dear Mr. Miller,

I am sorry that I am unable to refer you to potential customers for your
products because I have left the chamber of commerce for nearly five
years. You might ask the person in charge now.

If there\'s anything else that I can help you with, please let me know.

Yours sincerely,

Hugh Jackman

親愛的米勒先生：

很抱歉，我不能為你們的產品介紹潛在的客戶，因為我已經離開商會將近五年了。你們可以找現任的負責人詢問看看。

如有其他可以幫得上忙的地方，敬請告知。

休．傑克曼 謹上
