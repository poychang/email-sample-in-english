Dear Mr. Affleck,

I learned from your message by accident on the Internet that your
company needs car components.

We are a car parts manufacturer. I am sure you\'ll be interested in our
products. We do hope there is an opportunity for us to collaborate with
each other in the coming days.

An early reply will be obliged!

Yours sincerely,

Hugh Jackman

親愛的艾佛列克先生：

我偶然在網路上看到貴公司正需要汽車零件的資訊。

我們是一間汽車零件製造商。我確信您一定會對我們的產品感興趣。很希望我們不久能有機會合作。

若您能早日回覆，我們將不勝感謝。

休．傑克曼 謹上
