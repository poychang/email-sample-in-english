Dear Mr. Law,

We have got your email in which you complained about the quality of food
in our supermarket, and we have to say that your remark has had a bad
effect on our daily business to a certain degree.

As far as we know, the reason that your food spoiled is because you
didn\'t put them immediately in the fridge. We do hope you can eliminate
any negative effects caused by your remark. Thank you for you
cooperation.

Yours sincerely,

Tom Reeves

親愛的洛先生：

收到您發來的郵件，您抱怨我們超市的食品品質不好。我們不得不說，您的言論在一定程度上對我們的日常營業產生了不良影響。

據我們所知，您的食物之所以壞掉了是因為您沒有及時把他們放在冰箱裡。我們懇請您能消除相關負面影響。謝謝您的合作！

湯姆．李維 謹上
