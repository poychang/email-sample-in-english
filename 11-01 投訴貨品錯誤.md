Dear Mr. Bryan,

I received a consignment of order No. 201314 from you yesterday, but the
model No. is wrong. I ordered Model SP-520 instead of SP-502. Attached
please find our order No. 201314 for your reference. I will return this
shipment and the freight is at your cost.

Looking forward to receiving the correct shipment ASAP.

Sincerely yours,

Jackie Black

敬愛的布萊恩先生：

我昨天已經收到您訂單編號201314的出貨，但是型號是錯誤的。我所訂購的是型號SP-520，而不是SP-502。附上我們的訂單編號201314供你參考。我會將這批貨寄回，運費由你們支付。

期待能儘速收到正確的貨物。

杰奇．布萊克 謹上
