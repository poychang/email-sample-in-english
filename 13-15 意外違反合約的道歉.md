Dear Mr. Norris,

We apologize for failure to deliver your goods at scheduled time in
accordance with the contract we reached.

Unfortunately, owing to excessive demand last month, we were unable to
fill all orders on time. However, we will compensate all your economic
loss due to the unexpected violation of contract.

Thanks very much for your understanding.

Sincerely yours,

Shunda Company

親愛的那瑞斯先生：

非常抱歉我們未能在達成的合約中預定的時間交貨。

不幸的是，由於上個月訂單過多，我們沒能按時交付所有的訂單。不過，由於此次意外違反合約，我們會賠償您所有的經濟損失。

非常感謝您的諒解。

順達公司 謹上
