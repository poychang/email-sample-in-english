Dear Mr. Peter,

I would like to return the ten window curtains that arrived today.

The orange color is a bit darker than I expected. May I exchange them
for brighter ones? I will send them back if this is all right with you.
Please let me know whether you could send me other samples.

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours faithfully,

Betty Jones

親愛的彼得先生：

我想退掉今天收到的十個窗簾。

窗簾的橘色比我預期中的要暗一些。我能換成顏色更明亮些的嗎？如果您沒有意見的話，我將把它們寄回給您。請問您可否再寄一些樣品過來呢？

我希望儘快收到您的回覆。

貝蒂．瓊斯 謹上
