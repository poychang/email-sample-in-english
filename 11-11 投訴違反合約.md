Dear Mr. Kent,

Attached is our contract of Purchasing Order PO0801026 for your study.
It

seems that your company has not followed this contract for a long time,
which has cost us a lot of inconvenience for several months. Our
delivery should be once a month, and the quantity will be 20 dozens each
time. Please do follow this contract, otherwise you will have to bear
the consequences.

If you have any other questions, please contact me directly.

Sincerely Yours,

William Yang

敬愛的肯特先生：

附上我們訂購單PO0801026的合約供你閱讀，看起來你們公司已經有一段時間沒有照著合約走了，那造成我們好幾個月以來許多的不便。我們的交期應該是一個月一次，數量應該是每次二十打。請遵守這份合約，不然你將承擔後果。

如果有任何問題，請直接聯絡我。

威廉．楊 謹上
