Dear Mr. Jerry,

I regret to inform you that your damaged shipment arrived yesterday.
Several corners of your products are broken, which should be caused by
careless delivery. We hope that you have bought insurance for this
shipment. Anyway, I will send the damaged parts to you

COD. Please let Matthew know when they arrive, and he will take it over
from here.

If there are any other questions, please contact Matthew directly.

With Best Regards,

John Lin

敬愛的傑瑞先生：

我很遺憾地通知你有毀損的貨物已經抵達了。你的產品有好幾個角落都有破損，那應該是肇因於粗心的運送。希望你這批貨有買保險。不管怎樣，我將會把壞掉的部份以貨到付款方式寄回去給你。當它們抵達時請讓馬修知道，而且他會從這裡開始接手。

如果有任何其他的問題，請直接聯絡馬修。

約翰．林 謹上
