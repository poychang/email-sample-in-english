Dear Professor Cheng,

I am pleased to learn that you have an opportunity to spend a year away
from your institution to pursue research in Physics, and I\'d like to
ask you if I could have the honor to invite you to spend that year
working in my research group at MIT. I am sure it will be beneficial to
both of us.

I am very happy to cover all expenses, including the costs of living
expenses, travel costs and research costs.

I look forward to working with you.

Truly yours,

Robin Williams

親愛的程教授：

很高興獲悉您有機會離開貴院一年去做物理學的研究。我想請問您是否願意來麻省理工學院我們的科研組做一年的課題研究嗎？我相信我們雙方都能獲益良多。

我們非常樂於為你支付所有的費用，包括生\
活費用，旅行費用以及研究所需的費用。

期待與您共事。

羅賓．威廉斯 謹上
