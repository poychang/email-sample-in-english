Dear Mr. Young,

We have been waiting for the goods we ordered on February 26, 2009,
shipment notification NO. 5216-03A. You said they would be delivered by
the beginning of this week, but they still have not arrived yet.

Our business conditions specify a delivery date of Mar 2. If the
delivery is delayed any further, we will have to reconsider our plans to
deal with you in the future.

Please track the order immediately. Thank you very much for your earnest
efforts in taking care of this matter.

Yours truly,

Michael Cole

親愛的楊先生：

我們一直在等 2009 年 2 月 26 日所訂購的貨物，裝箱通知單的編號為
5216-03A。您說本周初就會出貨，但是並沒有到貨。

我們的貿易條件清楚地說明發貨日期是 3 月 2
日。如果發貨不斷地延誤，我們將不得不重新考慮和您以後的交易計畫。

請立即追蹤訂單。非常感謝您能認真處理此事。

邁克．科爾 謹上
