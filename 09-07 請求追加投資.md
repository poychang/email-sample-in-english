Dear Mr. Edward,

I am very glad that Talent Investment Company has been operating quite
well since its establishment.

However, we are now confronting a fiscal crisis because of the global
financial crisis. So I would like to know if it is possible for you to
make additional investment to help us bridge over the current
difficulty.

Thank you so much for your careful consideration and we hope for your
support!

Yours faithfully,

TIC

親愛的愛德華先生：

很高興敝公司（天才投資公司）自成立以來都運作得非常好。

然而，由於全球性的金融危機，我們現在也正面臨著財務危機。所以我想請問您可以再給我們追加一些投資來幫助我們度過難關嗎？

非常感謝您能慎重考慮，並期待著您的支持！

天才投資公司 謹上
