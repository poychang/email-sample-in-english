Dear Mr. Jonathan,

I was surprised to receive your bill of the last order. According to our
agreement, your commission should be 5% per order. But the unit price of
latest orders already included your commission, and you added the
commission again in the total amount. Therefore, your commission became
5.25% on latest orders. Please re-calculate and send another bill to us
as soon as you can.

Looking forward to receiving another bill very soon.

Sincerely Yours,

Ryan Mill

敬愛的強納生先生：

我接到你上一次訂單的帳單時嚇了一跳。如同我們的協議，你的佣金是每個訂單的百分之五。而最近訂單的單價已經包含了你的佣金，你又在計算總價時再加上5%。因此，你的佣金變成5.25%。請重新計算，然後再儘快送另一張帳單過來。

期待很快能收到你的帳單！

雷恩．米爾 謹上
