Dear Mr. Rice,

Could you please return the materials which I lent you last week?

As they are very important documents for my recent business, I really
need you to give them back as soon as you can.

I have already reminded you about them several times. Please don\'t let
such an unpleasant thing come between us.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,

Jason Depp

親愛的萊斯先生：

請問您現在可以歸還我上周借給你的資料了嗎？

由於那些是對我目前生意很重要的資料，我真的很需要您儘快把它們歸還給我。

我已經提醒您好幾次了。希望不要讓這樣一件不愉快的事情影響到我們的關係。

期待您的回覆！

傑森．戴普 謹上
