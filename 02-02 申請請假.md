Dear Boss:

I am afraid that I have to tell you the bad news.

Something terrible happened to me last weekend. I had a car accident and
thus broke my legs. Therefore, I have to inform you that maybe I cannot
go to work in the next few weeks because of this serious accident. So I
want to ask for a month\'s leave. Thank you for your consideration and
I\'m hoping for your approval.

Enclosed herewith is my X-ray photo for verification.

Sincerely yours,

Nancy Li

親愛的老闆：

很抱歉，我要告訴您一個壞消息。

這個週末我發生了一件令人無法置信的意外，我出了車禍，並且弄斷了腿。所以我必須通知您，由於這個嚴重的意外，我在接下來的幾個星期內無法到公司上班。特向您請一個月的假。望您考慮並予以批准。

隨信附上我的X光照片以茲證明。

南西．李 敬上
