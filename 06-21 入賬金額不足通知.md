Dear Mr. Burns,

We have received your telegraphic transfer of US\$3,000.00 on April 10,
2008. However, I am afraid you have neglected to add the cost of freight
that was indicated on the invoice we faxed to you.

We would therefore like to ask you to transfer an additional US\$150.00
so that we can ship the order to you.

On receipt of the full payment, we will immediately forward the goods.

Best regards,

NBC Corporation

親愛的伯恩斯先生：

我們已於2008年4月10日收到了您電匯的3000美元，但是您恐怕忘記加上運輸費用了。事實上，我們曾在傳真給您的發票上有註明。因此我們希望您再支付150美元運費，這樣我們就可以把貨物寄送給您了。

只要收到全額貨款，我們就會立即出貨。

致上最美好的祝福，

NBC 公司 謹上
