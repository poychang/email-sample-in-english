Dear Mr. Wills,

I am very sorry for the delay in issuing the receipt for you, as you
supposed, I was overwhelmed by awfully busy work then so that I forgot
to issue the receipt.

I have sent you the receipt of your purchase from us by express mail
today. I do apologize for any inconvenience the delay may lead to you.

Thank you very much for your understanding.

With best regards,

Friendship Store

親愛的威爾斯先生：

非常抱歉延遲為您開具收據。正如您猜想的，我當時的確是太忙了，以至於忘了給您開收據。今天我已經用快遞把您購物的收據寄給您了。對此可能給您帶來的不便，我感到非常地抱歉。

非常感謝您的諒解。

致上最誠摯的祝福，

友誼商店
