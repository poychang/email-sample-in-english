Dear Mr. Jacobi,

Your delivery of order No. 52099 has just arrived at our company a few
hours ago. However, we found a shortage of the quantity because only 400
PCs was received. Please explain this situation, and tell us when we can
receive the rest of the goods. And the freight caused will be on your
charge.

Looking forward to receiving the remaining shipment ASAP.

Sincerely yours,

Christina Chen

敬愛的賈克比先生：

你訂單編號52099的出貨在幾個小時前已經抵達我們公司，然而我們發現數量短少了，只收到400件。請解釋這個狀況，並告訴我們其他的貨物何時可以寄過來。至於因此所產生的運費將由你們支付。

期待能儘速收到其餘的貨物。

克里斯汀娜．陳 謹上
