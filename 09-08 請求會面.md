Dear Mr. Richard,

I am going to visit Los Angeles on Saturday, October 4, 2008. By the
way, may I have the opportunity of paying you a visit with the purpose
to discuss the current financial crisis?

May I suggest 4:00 p.m. on Sunday, October 5, as a convenient time for
my visit? If it is not fine with you, perhaps you would be kind enough
to let me know a time convenient for you.

Hoping to meet you soon!

Sincerely yours,

David Rex

親愛的理查先生：

我將於2008年10月4日星期六去洛杉磯。我可以有這個榮幸順便去拜訪您，並探討一下當今的金融危機？

如果您10月5日下午四點方便的話，我可以去拜訪您嗎？如果不行的話，或許還有其他您比較方便的時間，可以告知我嗎？

期待著與您會面！

大衛．雷克斯 謹上
