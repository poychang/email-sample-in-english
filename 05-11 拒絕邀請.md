Dear Henry,

My friend, thank you for your letter of May 2.

Your letter says there will be a get-together on May 6 in Bluestone
Park, and you want to invite me to the party with you. However, I am
awfully sorry to tell you that on that day I am going to see an old
friend who\'s\
seriously ill. So I am afraid it\'s impossible for me to go with you
then.

I believe that you can find another partner soon.

Yours faithfully,

Rose

親愛的亨利：

我的朋友，謝謝你五月二號寫給我的信。

你信上說五月六號在藍石公園有一個聯歡會，你想邀請我和你去一起參加。然而，我感到非常抱歉，那天我要去探望一個重病的朋友，所以我恐怕沒辦法陪你去了。

我相信你一定能很快找到另一個伙伴的。

羅絲 謹上
