Dear Mr. Collins,

I would like to request more information about your company.

Compared with other similar products, I am planning to invest in your
hearing aids because of their better performances. I would appreciate
any brochures or marketing materials with which you could provide me.

Thank you in advance. I am looking forward to your reply.

Yours sincerely,

Willy Miller

親愛的柯林斯先生：

我想諮詢有關貴公司的更多的資訊。

與其他同類產品比較之後，發現你們的助聽器性能更佳，所以，我打算投資你們的助聽器生產。如果您能將一些公司業務簡介或市場銷售資料提供給我，將不勝感激。

先謝謝您了，並期待您的來信！

威利．米勒 謹上
