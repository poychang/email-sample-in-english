Dear Ms. Steele,

I am writing to let you know a decision of mine.

I want to resign from the NCB Company for some personal reason.
Moreover, I will be starting a new position with the Government
Bookstore as an office manager. I think perhaps that job would be more
suitable for me. Anyway, I am still going to express many thanks for
your support while I was there.

I hope everything goes well!

Faithfully yours,

Bill

親愛的史蒂爾女士：

我寫信是要告訴您關於我的決定。

由於私人原因，我想從NCB公司辭職。另外，我將要開始轉換跑道去做政府刊物書店的經理。我想那份工作或許更適合我。無論如何，我都要感謝您過去對我的支持與照顧。

祝您一切順利！

比爾 謹上
