Dear Martin,

I couldn\'t be happier to learn that you have got the scholarship to
Yale University and I think no one could have been more deserving than
you. It\'s great that your dream to study abroad has finally come true.
Congratulations!

Your hard work and your industriousness combined with your gift indicate
a dynamic future. I wish you all the best in your study.

Sincerely yours,

Terry
