Dear Mr. Kenny,

I was terribly sorry to know that you want to cancel our order No.
PO0907020 this morning. Several deliveries of the components of the
products had been delivered to your company in these months. I already
dispatched our engineers to solve the software problem in your factory.
Please tell me what else I can do about this matter.

Looking forward to hearing good news from you.

Sincerely Yours,

Vincent Lin

敬愛的肯尼先生：

我深懷歉意得知，今天早上聽到要取消我們的訂單PO0907020。在這幾個月來這個產品的零組件已經分批寄到你的公司，我也已經調度了幾位工程師到你們工廠去解決軟體問題。請告訴我在這件事上還有什麼可以做的。

期待能收到你的好消息！

文森．林 謹上
